          <p class="black-text">IEEE appeared from the union of two engineering societies in the early sixties, the IRE (Institute of Radio Engineers) and the AIEE (American Institute of Electrical Engineers). The IEEE is essentially a society for Electrical and Computer Engineers, but it also welcomes Computer Scientists and Physicists. IEEE is what is known as a technical professional society. Every engineering branch has a technical professional society, Civil Engineering has ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers), Mechanical Engineering has ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers).</p>
          <p style="color: black;">What distinguishes IEEE from this other societies is the fact that IEEE is international. There are IEEE chapters in every continent, and in almost every country, and in those countries where IEEE is not established it has links with the local engineering societies, such as the case with IKE (Institution of Electrical Engineers) in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This makes IEEE the largest engineering society in the world.</p>

                      IEEE IAS DAIICT Student Branch Chapter organised a visit to Akshaya Patra Foundation on 27th October 2018. It is a non-profit organisation in India that runs school lunch programme across India. Akshaya Patra was established in 2000. It has its kitchens in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Chattisgarh, and many places in India. It has the largest kitchen in Bangalore and second largest in Ahmedabad. Due to incapability of accomodating more students at a time in the kitchen area, only ten students were invited for the visit.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/akshayPatra.jpg" alt="Tachyon Img" class="responsive-img" style="width:100% height: 500px">
                    <p>
                      We were warmly welcomed by the officials of Akshaya Patra Foundation. They gave us brief information about their organisation, their aim and how they have been constantly striving to achieve it. The tour was about to start before which we were given shoe and hair covers to wear before entering the area. The kitchen is structured in such a way to exploit te force of gravity. It has three floors where the dishes are cooked simultaneously. All the machines and vessels used in the kitchen are manufactured in India. They have aptly made use of the technology in the right spirit. The whole kitchen was very clean and well managed by sufficient workforce. Also, the nutrition value of the food is strictly taken care of. The whole process was explained very nicely by the officials who offered us some biscuits from the bakery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As the students from the technical domain, it was an incredible experience to watch such a simple process like cooking being carried out in such an inconceivably massive scale with full automation. They have truely exploited the boons of technology for such a noble cause. It was a great experience visiting Akshaya Patra Foundation. Everyone was greatful for this opportunity to know how the world's largest NGO-run Mid-Day Meal programme is carried out.

The tour was about to start before which we were given shoe and hair covers to wear before entering the area. The kitchen is structured in such a way to exploit te force of gravity. It has three floors where the dishes are cooked simultaneously. All the machines and vessels used in the kitchen are manufactured in India. They have aptly made use of the technology in the right spirit. The whole kitchen was very clean and well managed by sufficient workforce. Also, the nutrition value of the food is strictly taken care of. The whole process was explained very nicely by the officials who offered us some biscuits from the bakery.

                    As the students from the technical domain, it was an incredible experience to watch such a simple process like cooking being carried out in such an inconceivably massive scale with full automation. They have truely exploited the boons of technology for such a noble cause. It was a great experience visiting Akshaya Patra Foundation. Everyone was greatful for this opportunity to know how the world's largest NGO-run Mid-Day Meal programme is carried out.

IEEE IAS DA-IICT Student Branch Chapter organized a technical hands-on session on Git and Github on 4th April, 2018 in CEP 110, DA-IICT. The speaker of the session was Mr. Khushil Mistry, a third year B.Tech student of DA-IICT. The session witnessed nearly 120 students who displayed great enthusiasm and keenness the whole time. Mr. Khushil Mistry began by giving an introduction to Git and explained its need in the world of collaborative development and research. He emphasized that nearly all multinational companies use this software for effective code development and maintenance. According to him, knowing Git is one of the most sought after industrial skills in the recent times. He introduced students to some of the very basic commands like creating a directory and adding files in it, making commits and listing out all the previous commits. He explained the commands used to save different versions of a file, to revert back to previous versions and to move to a specific version of a file. The students also learnt the code to find difference between versions and to merge various versions. This can be useful when two developers working on the same software want to merge their code into one file.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Throughout the session, IEEE IAS DA-IICT Student Branch Chapter executive committee constantly volunteered in helping the students with their doubts to make sure everyone was on the same page as the speaker. This ensured that the session ran smoothly. It was a proud moment for IEEE IAS DA-IICT Student Branch Chapter to see the students with contentful smiles at the end of the session.

Students visited village’s own RO system plant. This town arranges awareness camps and sessions for the people so as to equip them with the new technologies and facilities they are provided with and how they are meant for the betterment of the people. The village isn't inspired from any other village or city, but had its own road-map of development. Also the village has constantly opposed establishing any industry or project that takes away the essence of a village, making people understand the difference between a smart city and a smart village. Students had a fantastic trip and came back with light memories and an introspection that was long-lasting.

                      IEEE IAS SB chapter DA-IICT organized a talk on ‘Where Engineering leads?’on 1st April 2016 at 5 pm in conference room, CEP. Mr.Hakimuddin Ali - Managing Director and BU Head - India, South Africa and Middle East, Caldreys Refractories Ltd. was the speaker for the evening.He was accompanied by Prof.Dr. Anil Roy and Mr. Gaurang Shah who supported IAS in organising the talk. The speaker emphasized on three major points - the need of quality experience to tackle the real world problems, having ‘EQ higher than average IQ’  and the third being ‘Invest in yourself’. The session ended with a few questions by our future engineers which he answered tactfully with his experience and knowledge. In this world where we hear ‘No’ and ‘Don’t Do’, he advised us to come out of it and do what you decide to, not listening to the negative storytellers.
